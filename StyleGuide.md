Notes for weldrists writing for weldr.io.

## Author info

Add a page for yourself in `_authors/`, like so:

    ---
    userid: wwoods
    name: Will Woods
    email: wwoods@redhat.com
    github: wgwoods
    ---
    
    THIS IS MY AUTHOR PAGE, WOW

Now when you're writing a post, you can add something like:

    author: wwoods

to the "front matter", and then we'll have a reference to info about whoever
wrote the post.

(Be sure to include the `github` username, because we might grab the github
user avatar to use an avatar for you on the page.)
